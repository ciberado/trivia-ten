Using the opentdb json format, write me ten questions for a quiz focused on the following aws topics: 

* The concept of "an account"
* How to manage a complex aws company footprint with multiple accounts.
* Different security identity types.
* Security policies (such as IAM policies, permission boundaries, resource policies and SCP).
* Organizations service.
* IAM service.
* Identity center.

If possible, write the questions as scenarios intended to be understood by a architect.
