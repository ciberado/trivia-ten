# AWS AI Practitioner Certification

## Question 1

A company makes forecasts each quarter to decide how to optimize operations to meet expected demand. The company uses ML models to make these forecasts.

An AI practitioner is writing a report about the trained ML models to provide transparency and explainability to company stakeholders.

What should the AI practitioner include in the report to meet the transparency and explainability requirements?

### Correct answers

* Partial dependence plots (PDPs)

#### Explanation

**Partial dependence plots (PDPs)** are visualization tools that show the relationship between specific input features and model predictions while keeping other variables constant. They provide stakeholders with clear, interpretable insights into how individual features influence forecasting outcomes without requiring deep technical knowledge of the model's internal workings. PDPs are essential for transparency as they visually demonstrate the impact of changes in input variables on predictions, making them ideal for explaining model behavior to non-technical stakeholders.

### Incorrect answers

* Code for model training
* Sample data for training
* Model convergence tables

#### Explanation

**Code for model training** is primarily useful for technical teams and developers but doesn't provide meaningful transparency or explainability to business stakeholders who need to understand model decisions rather than implementation details.

**Sample data for training** may raise privacy concerns and doesn't directly explain how the model makes predictions or which features drive specific outcomes.

**Model convergence tables** contain technical metrics about the training process that are difficult for non-technical stakeholders to interpret and don't provide insights into the model's decision-making logic.
