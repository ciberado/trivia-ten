      "question": "A company is planning to create a service that requires encryption in transit. The traffic must not be decrypted between the client and the backend of the service. The company will implement the service by using the gRPC protocol over TCP port 443. The service will scale up to thousands of simultaneous connections. The backend of the service will be hosted on an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configured. The company needs to use mutual TLS for two-way authentication between the client and the backend.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
      "correct_answer": "Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure a Network Load Balancer with a TCP listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.",

        "hint": "Focus on which load balancer type and listener configuration allows encrypted traffic to pass through without decryption, and consider whether targeting Pods directly versus nodes matters for Kubernetes autoscaling.",
        "rationale": "End-to-end encryption with mutual TLS requires a passthrough architecture where the load balancer does not decrypt traffic. Only a Network Load Balancer with a TCP listener (Layer 4) can forward encrypted packets without termination, while targeting Pod IPs directly enables efficient Kubernetes-native scaling."
