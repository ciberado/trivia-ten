      "question": "A company is planning to create a service that requires encryption in transit. The traffic must not be decrypted between the client and the backend of the service. The company will implement the service by using the gRPC protocol over TCP port 443. The service will scale up to thousands of simultaneous connections. The backend of the service will be hosted on an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configured. The company needs to use mutual TLS for two-way authentication between the client and the backend.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
