If a book is too long, and its tokenized version exceeds this limit, the model cannot process it in a single input. This causes the application to fail when trying to summarize very long books in one pass.\n\nA. Temperature too high – Affects randomness/creativity, not the ability to process inputs.\n\nB.

For custom (fine-tuned) models on Amazon Bedrock, deploying to production requires purchasing Provisioned Throughput; on-demand mode is not available for most custom models. Provisioned Throughput reserves dedicated model units and provides a guaranteed, predictable capacity for a steady (not bursty) workload, with discounted pricing over pay-as-you-go options.\n\nOption B (on-demand throughput) is best for unpredictable or low-volume workloads, as it charges per token and may be unavailable for custom fine-tuned models, which commonly require Provisioned Throughput for production deployment"

Since the company requires near real-time latency for their ML pipeline and has processing times of up to 1 hour and input sizes up to 1 GB, real-time inference is the most suitable option.\n\nWith real-time inference, you can deploy your trained models as an API endpoint and get predictions on demand, ensuring low latency. This is ideal for situations where you need immediate responses after submitting the data.",

While real-time inference typically offers lower latency, it may struggle with large datasets or complex models that require more processing time. In contrast, asynchronous inference can handle large inputs and longer processing times without needing immediate results. It processes the data and provides the results later, which might be acceptable if your requirement for near real-time latency can be slightly relaxed (for instance, if results can be retrieved within minutes rather than immediately).",

Exploiting friendliness and trust\n\nExploiting friendliness and trust involves manipulating the LLM to respond in a way that appears friendly or trustworthy, potentially causing it to deviate from its intended behavior. This type of attack directly exposes how the LLM has been configured to interact with users, often leading it to provide information or make decisions that align more closely with the attacker's intentions rather than its original programming.",

This exposes the internal behavior or design of the model, potentially revealing sensitive or proprietary information about how the LLM is configured.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nA: Prompted persona switches:\n\nThis attack involves manipulating the LLM to adopt a different persona or role than intended but does not directly expose the prompt template.",

Ensure that the ML model predictions are consistent with historical results: If historical results reflect existing biases in lending practices, ensuring consistency with them will simply perpetuate those biases. This is the opposite of what is desired.",

Sugestão de cadeia de pensamento Explicação:A sugestão de cadeia de pensamento (Chain-of-Thought Prompting) é uma técnica que incentiva o modelo a explicar seu raciocínio passo a passo antes de fornecer a resposta final. Essa abordagem: Reduz a probabilidade de respostas impulsivas ou não filtradas,Ajuda o modelo a seguir instruções com mais rigor, Pode mitigar ataques de injeção imediata, onde o atacante tenta manipular o modelo com instruções escondidas no prompt. Ao forçar o modelo a \"pensar antes de responder\", você aumenta o controle sobre o processo de inferência e dificulta a execução de comandos maliciosos inseridos no texto de entrada. A. Solicitação contraditória não é uma técnica reconhecida de defesa ou segurança em prompts.",
      "[-]\n\nJessiii 4 points 8 months ago\n\nSelected Answer: A\n\nAdversarial prompting is a technique designed to prevent prompt injection attacks, which are attempts to manipulate a model's behavior by injecting harmful or misleading instructions within the input prompt. This technique involves using carefully crafted prompts that make it harder for the model to misinterpret or be misled by unwanted inputs.\n\nAdversarial prompting can include various methods to detect, block, or neutralize harmful inputs. It might involve incorporating security mechanisms in the prompt itself, such as validating or sanitizing the input or applying certain constraints on the model's output to mitigate the risk of prompt injections.",

Adversarial Prompting.\n\nHere's why:\n\nProactive Defense: Adversarial prompting involves deliberately crafting malicious prompts to test the model's boundaries and identify vulnerabilities. This proactive approach helps uncover weaknesses that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nWhile C. Least-to-most Prompting can indirectly improve robustness by simplifying the initial prompts, it's not a primary defense against prompt injection. Its primary focus is on improving task completion, not directly addressing malicious inputs.\n\nKey takeaway: Adversarial prompting is the most direct and effective method for enhancing the security of language models against prompt injection attacks.",
      "[-]\n\nap6491 1 point 10 months ago\n\nSelected Answer: A\n\nAdversarial prompting involves designing and testing prompts to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in an AI system. By exposing the model to potential manipulation scenarios during development, practitioners can adjust the model or its responses to defend against prompt injection attacks.\n\nThis technique helps ensure the model behaves as intended, even when malicious or cleverly crafted prompts are used to bypass restrictions or elicit undesirable outputs."

It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model’s ability to correctly identify relevant information while minimizing false positives and false negatives.\n\nIn the context of a help desk model, you want to measure both the precision (correctness of answers) and recall (how well the model retrieves the relevant information).
